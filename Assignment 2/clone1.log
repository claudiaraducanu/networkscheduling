Tried aggregator 0 times.
No LP presolve or aggregator reductions.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (0.51 ticks)
Parallel mode: using up to 6 threads for barrier.
Number of nonzeros in lower triangle of A*A' = 5545
Using Approximate Minimum Degree ordering
Total time for automatic ordering = 0.00 sec. (3.26 ticks)
Barrier time = 0.00 sec. (4.31 ticks)
